## Examples
Here are examples of input and assistant output, pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it is.

<example>
    <user:input>
    Student Input: It's so hot here in Mumbai, having 4 air-conditioners also not enough.
    </user:input>
    <assistant:output>
BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank - 

    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a table of vocabulary to get you started:
Japanese	| Romaji	| English
            |atsui	    |   hot
            |koko	    |	here
            |Mumbai	    |	Mumbai
            |reit≈çki	|	air conditioner
            |yaru	    |	to do, to have
            |tariru	    |	enough
            |aru	    |	to have, to exist
What do you think the Japanese translation of "It's" could be?
