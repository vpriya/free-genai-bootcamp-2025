        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a table of vocabulary to get you started:
        Japanese	| Romaji	| English
                    |atsui	    |   hot
                    |koko	    |	here
                    |Mumbai	    |	Mumbai
                    |reit≈çki	|	air conditioner
                    |yaru	    |	to do, to have
                    |tariru	    |	enough
                    |aru	    |	to have, to exist
        What do you think the Japanese translation of "It's" could be?
