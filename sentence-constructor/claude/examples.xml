    Let me help you construct this sentence! Here's the vocabulary you'll need:
JapaneseRomajiEnglishクマkumabearドアdoadoorゴミgomigarbage出すdasuto put out/take outいるiruto exist (for living things)
Sentence Structure:
This will need to be broken into two parts since it's a compound sentence:

First part: "[Bears] [at the door] [exist]"


Remember: Location comes before the verb in Japanese
Use いる for living things (bears)


Second part: "[garbage] [put out] [question marker]"


Consider which tense you need for 出す
Think about how to make it a question

Clues and considerations:

How do we show location in Japanese? Think about which particle marks location
What particle do we use to mark the subject (bears)?
How do we connect these two parts? Consider what particle shows cause/reason
For the second part, how do make the verb past tense?
Don't forget the question marker か at the end

Would you like to try constructing the first part of the sentence?
